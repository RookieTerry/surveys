# surveys

Code for various crypto-survey related stuff. 

The current code collects and collates keys and sees which of those
are the same. Needs proper documentation - that'll happen shortly
is the plan:-) 

- ```install-deps.sh``` is a first cut at an installer for dependencies
- ```skey-all.sh``` is a script to orchestrate things
- ```Makefile``` can be used for bits'n'pieces in various ways
- The ```misc``` directory has various bits and pieces knocked up along
the way in case they prove handy later.
